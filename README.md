### WindowsPrivacyGuide
The ultimate guide for anonymizing Windows as much as possible.
This guide will cover everything you need to know in a simple matter for anonymizing, de-bloating, and optimizing the operating-system Windows 10 as much as possible.
Newer Windows OS' such as 10 & 11 have many unnecessary programs and files, as well as many options that spy on you by default, as well as collecting all of your information.
WindowsPrivacyGuide will respect your time, and will enlighten you in this compiled guide of how to take back your privacy when using the Windows OS.
Do keep in mind that this guide primarily targets Windows 10 due to it not being in the spotlight as much, as well as it being preferred for privacy and all around convenience.
This guide will be in order from what you should do first, to what you should do last. Photos will be included for those that would like precise instructions that are easy-to-follow.

Chapter 1. Boot Installation & Configuration
------

Let's start from the complete beginning of the installation. This guide assumes you already aware of how to install the Windows 10 OS. I will not be explaining how to install Windows 10 OS, but rather, showing you what to disable on installation before you're prompted to the desktop. Firstly, it's important for you to NOT enable WiFi just yet! If you have an Ethernet plugged in, please disable it before continuing. Once your internet-connection is disabled, select the 'I don't have internet.' option, so you don't have to sign in. Following this path will give you what's called a local account, or an offline account. Proceed with installation, making sure Cortana is NOT enabled as well as disabling all checkboxes, and after, you should be able to proceed with installation and be prompted onto your desktop momentarily.

In the Windows 10 settings, there is various options we should modify / disable for our privacy. To open settings, press the Windows key, and select the gear icon in the bottom left. After that, I recommend going through each tab and disabling as much as possible that you deem a privacy threat / spyware. Starting in 'Updates & Security' and working our way up, we fill first click into the tab and follow the settings below.
